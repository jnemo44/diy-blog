          <p>Hi! I'm Joe.</p>

          <p>
            I'm currently a full time flight test engineer 🛩️ that's still trying to decide what I want to be when I grow up 🧙. I love running and enjoy building things online so this is my space to combine 🏃‍♂️ ➕ 💻.

            Follow along as I test web development ideas and write about the glamorous life of a semi-pro runner!

            Oh and about the stats card on the home page. I started uploading runs to Strava in 2014 after I graduated from college. So the total miles number
            does not include anything from my time as a runner in highschool or college where I was a division ✌ XC and track runner. And I like it that way. I want to show people that awesome fitness can carry on long after school, a job, marriage, and possibly even 4 kids!
