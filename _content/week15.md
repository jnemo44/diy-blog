15 weeks in. The rest day has turned into a 45 minute easy run so I have run everyday for the past month! The workouts are getting longer and more difficult and yes at this point I'm tired all time. I go to bed at 9 and do not exactly jump out of bed at 7. But I was telling Jas this week how thankfully surprised I am that I have **ZERO** body pain. **NONE!**

This is new for me as I remember my last marathon buildup in 2019-2020 I always felt on the edge of breaking. I even remember the week before Houston 2020 dealing with sharp knee pain that I thought would impact the race.

Honestly, I am not going to claim I know why, but what I will pass along is what I'm doing that seems to have worked at least for 15 weeks.

- Sleeping 8-10 hours
- Bone broth in most meals (all Jas's idea)
- Drinking raw milk daily
- Collagen in coffee every other day
- Zero booze
- Using Tailwind post longrun/workout
- Bloodwork last month (gives me confidence my fatigue isn't low iron)
- 15 minutes of rolling and stretching 3x per week
- Workouts in fast but cushy shoes
- Just started fueling during long runs

And that's about it as far as running specific things. I'm just really thankful God has blessed me with health and body strength during this buildup.
