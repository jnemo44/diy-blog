**Change of plans!!!** I have decided to drop out of California International Marathon in December and instead run as part of the ADP (American Development Program) field at Houston in January. It was a tough decision to make, but here are the decision factors...

#### **CIM Pros**
- This is a race I've always wanted to do
- USATF championship race this year!
- Comped entry
  
#### **CIM Cons**
- 8-10 hour travel times out to Sacremento that would mess with my sleep and are $$$
- Unable to have any family travel out
- December is a only a month away!!
  
#### **Houston Pros**
- Within driving range so family can attend
- An extra 45 days of training
- I set my marathon PR here in 2020

#### **Houston Cons**
- A 9 hour drive split over two days

Over the past few weeks the key driver for this decision ultimatley aligns with my **WHYs** for my current buildup. I will run fast and my family will be included. **Houston** checks both boxes!

For those not familiar with the running world here are the luxuries provided to an almost professional runner...

- Complimentary entry to the race 
- A small pre-race stretching/warm-up area **with port-a-cans** üí©üí™ 
- A priority starting location just behind the elites and ahead of the open field. 

In all seriousness though having access to bathrooms near the start line is a top luxury. It's like a peasant boy taking ownership of a golden chalice üèÜ during the middle ages. Truly life changing. If you know you know.

## **Health**
Most of this week was done on a treadmill in the BAHAMAS. It was awesome. However, upon arriving home my wife and 2 of my kids were sick. One was up every hour through the night to throw up. So yea didn't sleep Friday which meant an off day Saturday and pushing the long run to week 11. So a lower volume week, but I havn't gotten sick yet and I was able to execute my long run workout on Monday! Body is healthy and strong!
