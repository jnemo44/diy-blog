I finally made a decision! Iâ€™m signed up for CIM. Iâ€™m still a runner ðŸ˜‚

Since my last race in May (25k RBR), which in one sense was a win because I finished alive on a hot day with the highest place Iâ€™ve ever gotten (11th). However, on the other hand it was not the PR Iâ€™d trained for and honestly just left me asking myself why I choose to go through so much pain to run at this level. Pile onto the fact it was the start of summer and we had just purchased and moved into a new house and with a full time job and a schedule full of family activities I just needed a break from running. I told myself two weeks then Iâ€™d get back to training. Three weeks went by. Then a month. Then another month. Yes itâ€™s 1,000 degrees in Florida, but I just had no desire to get back to real training. I was enjoying just running 30-45 minutes a day 5 or 6 days a week and just being done. Short and sweet.

Honestly, I was at the point where Iâ€™m starting to be ok with this reality. Iâ€™ve run competitively now for more than 15 years and Iâ€™ve made awesome memories and pushed my body further then I ever thought possible. Iâ€™m happy and thankful for everything this sport has taught me and maybe it was time to walk. 

But I still had a compâ€™d entry into CIM which recently turned into the USATF Marathon Championship that expired in August. So I signed up. 

Iâ€™m sorry but this post has no grand answer about some epic revelation. I talked with my wife and to God and this past Sunday I decided to sign up and just take the next best step. I donâ€™t really know how Iâ€™m going to pull it off, but my intent is to go sub 2:17 in the marathon in December.

I think what I want to remember about this decision is that it was not clear and despite my desire for a perfect PLAN to execute too maybe I need to release what I canâ€™t control and just TAKE THE NEXT STEP. (Mantra baby)
