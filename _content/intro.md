The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that `<li>` elements aren't given a child `<p>` tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.

- **For example, here's another nested list.**

  But this time with a second paragraph.

  - These list items won't have `<p>` tags
  - Because they are only one line each

- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**

  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.

  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `<p>` tag.

    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.

  - Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.

- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?

And finally a sentence to close off this section.

## There are other elements we need to style

I almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.

We even included table styles, check it out:

| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Bret "The Hitman" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |
| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |
| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |
| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |
| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |

We also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `<span>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.

### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings

Even though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _"wrap the code blocks in backticks"_ trick works pretty well though really.

Another thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the [`tailwindcss/docs`](https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs) repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.

#### We haven't used an `h4` yet

But now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.

We don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.

### We still need to think about stacked headings though.

#### Let's make sure we don't screw that up with `h4` elements, either.

Phew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they look pretty good.

Let's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.

What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final sentence can't hurt.

  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.

    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
    springing up around the country.

I finally made a decision! Iâ€™m signed up for CIM. Iâ€™m still a runner ðŸ˜‚

Since my last race in May (25k RBR), which in one sense was a win because I finished alive on a hot day with the highest place Iâ€™ve ever gotten (11th). However, on the other hand it was not the PR Iâ€™d trained for and honestly just left me asking myself why I choose to go through so much pain to run at this level. Pile onto the fact it was the start of summer and we had just purchased and moved into a new house and with a full time job and a schedule full of family activities I just needed a break from running. I told myself two weeks then Iâ€™d get back to training. Three weeks went by. Then a month. Then another month. Yes itâ€™s 1,000 degrees in Florida, but I just had no desire to get back to real training. I was enjoying just running 30-45 minutes a day 5 or 6 days a week and just being done. Short and sweet.

Honestly, I was at the point where Iâ€™m starting to be ok with this reality. Iâ€™ve run competitively now for more than 15 years and Iâ€™ve made awesome memories and pushed my body further then I ever thought possible. Iâ€™m happy and thankful for everything this sport has taught me and maybe it was time to walk. 

But I still had a compâ€™d entry into CIM which recently turned into the USATF Marathon Championship that expired in August. So I signed up. 

Iâ€™m sorry but this post has no grand answer about some epic revelation. I talked with my wife and to God and this past Sunday I decided to sign up and just take the next best step. I donâ€™t really know how Iâ€™m going to pull it off, but my intent is to go sub 2:17 in the marathon in December.

I think what I want to remember about this decision is that it was not clear and despite my desire for a perfect PLAN to execute too maybe I need to release what I canâ€™t control and just TAKE THE NEXT STEP. (Mantra baby)
