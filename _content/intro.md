I finally made a decision! I’m signed up for CIM. I’m still a runner 😂

Since my last race in May (25k RBR), which in one sense was a win because I finished alive on a hot day with the highest place I’ve ever gotten (11th). However, on the other hand it was not the PR I’d trained for and honestly just left me asking myself why I choose to go through so much pain to run at this level. Pile onto the fact it was the start of summer and we had just purchased and moved into a new house and with a full time job and a schedule full of family activities I just needed a break from running. I told myself two weeks then I’d get back to training. Three weeks went by. Then a month. Then another month. Yes it’s 1,000 degrees in Florida, but I just had no desire to get back to real training. I was enjoying just running 30-45 minutes a day 5 or 6 days a week and just being done. Short and sweet.

Honestly, I was at the point where I’m starting to be ok with this reality. I’ve run competitively now for more than 15 years and I’ve made awesome memories and pushed my body further then I ever thought possible. I’m happy and thankful for everything this sport has taught me and maybe it was time to walk. 

But I still had a comp’d entry into CIM which recently turned into the USATF Marathon Championship that expired in August. So I signed up. 

I’m sorry but this post has no grand answer about some epic revelation. I talked with my wife and to God and this past Sunday I decided to sign up and just take the next best step. I don’t really know how I’m going to pull it off, but my intent is to go sub 2:17 in the marathon in December.

I think what I want to remember about this decision is that it was not clear and despite my desire for a perfect PLAN to execute too maybe I need to release what I can’t control and just TAKE THE NEXT STEP. (Mantra baby)
