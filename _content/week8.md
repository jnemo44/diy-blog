**HI JASMIN!!!!** You'll be so happy to know that due to my stomach bug last week, I had leg energy for 7 days of running in week 8. This resulted in a high watermark of XX miles for this marathon buildup.

I am **NOT** a high mileage runner. I've actually only ever gone over 100 miles per week like once or twice and that was back in college. I've found that my probability of injury sky rockets when I approach 80-90 miles so my "high" mileage sweet spot is around **70 mpw**. In fact for my PR marathon of 2:17 I was right around 70 mpw. It's better to be undertrained and healthy then overtrained and broken. 

My secret weapon is training my mind to be strong on race day with visualization and treating race day like a professional

## **Health**
No health issues this week. Legs are **VERY** tired after Sunday's run, but no lingering pain.
