For this race I represented Operation Underground Railroad, which is an organization working to end modern day slavery. If my running has ever inspired you would you consider joining the fight?

## Post Race Thoughts
- I probably was too active the week of Thanksgiving. I did a 15:18 5k (Interval Pace) followed by lots of time on legs playing backyard football and just general running/walking around chasing kids being a Dad and Uncle. No regrets, but when your quads start to go at 14 on a perfect day you search for answers. Maybe a 16 flat 5k and being QB instead of CB playing man coverage?

- The elite field was epic. So many guys running 5:15 pace for most of the race. So fun not being alone. It was a really cool experience miles 5-9 just listenting to the shoes and the general teamwork vibe. Pacers did an excellent job slowing us after a few faster miles.

- CIM is an AWESOME marathon especially if you can get into the Elite field. Danielle and the CIM team took amazing care of us and there is not one thing about the race itself that I can point to as a contributer to not going sub 2:18. They did **EVERYTHING** to help ensure our success. Despite not achieving my objective and unlike Napa I would totally come back to SAC for another go.

- I went with a PacePro setup on Garmin and although it worked well it took me about 8 miles to figure out that every mile split it was showing me was my planned pace not my actual pace. So it was showing 5:17 those first few miles but my splits were faster then that. I had a field right next to it that had that info I just didn't look at it. I don't think that was a deal breaker, but given my mistakes at Houston and my intentionality to be conservative this race I'm a little bummed I was a little fast for miles 3, 4, and 5 (5:07, 5:08, 5:05). I could have done that 5k 30 seconds slower and maybe that would have bought me a mile or two more on the backend.

- Since it was my quads that gave out first I think it would have been good to add the month of August to this cycle. I started in September and although 3 months is sufficient I did get sick twice for a few days in that 3 months. So to account for that next time I need 4 months to get 3 months of training.
