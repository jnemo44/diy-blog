If week 6 was a **high** week 7 was most definitely a **low**. I think it was a stomach bug, but whatever it was it zapped my energy and sent my resting heart rate up **10 bpm!** 

On Wednesday instead of executing the planned workout I suffered through a 65 minute easy run. Still thinking it was just training fatigue I geared up for the workout on Thrusday, however 5 minutes into the warmup I knew I was toasted and the workout was just not happening. My stomach hurt and and I called it a day after a half mile. Checking my watch I saw an interesting RHR graph that confirmed how I was feeling...

Normally my RHR is **~39 bpm**, but to see the linear increase up to **50 bpm** told me my body was fighting something. I typically don't let my watch dictate what I do or how I feel, but it was good to see it confirm how I was feeling. On Friday I ran 2 miles just to see how things were feeling and by Saturday I was able to run for an hour.

Not **EVERY** week can be the best week ever, but if you can hang in there through the bad weeks that's when the magic happens!

A stomach bug caused me to miss the quality sessions this week and knocked my total volume down. As of Sunday though everything seems to be back to normal and ready to go for a normal week 8.
