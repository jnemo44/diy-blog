If week 6 was a **high** week 7 of marathon training was most definitely a **low**. I think it was a stomach bug, but whatever it was it zapped my energy and sent my resting heart rate up almost **10 bpm!** 

So on Wednesday instead of executing the planned workout I suffered through a 65 minute easy run and deferred the workout to Thursday. It was the **HARDEST** easy run in the history of easy runs.  

Still thinking it was just training fatigue I geared up for the workout on Thursday, but 5 minutes into the warmup I was toasted and knew the workout was just not happening. My stomach hurt and I called it a day after a paltry half mile. Checking my watch I saw an interesting resting heart rate (RHR) graph that seemed to confirm how I was feeling...

Normally my RHR is **~39 bpm**, but to see the linear increase up to almost **50 bpm** told me my body was indeed fighting something. Generally speaking I don't let my watch dictate what I do or how I feel, but it was good to see it confirm how I was feeling. 

**Friday** came and I still was not feeling great so I ran 2 miles just to see how things were feeling and to breathe air. By **Saturday** I was able to run for an hour and things were getting back to normal.

Not **EVERY** week can be the best week ever, but if you can hang in there through the bad weeks that's when the **magic** happens! This week was just a minor speed bump in what I hope will continue to be an awesome marathon buildup!
