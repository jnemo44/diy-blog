Some runs build fitness others build guts. Sunday's long run this week was the latter. 90 degrees with a dewpoint of 67 made 17 miles borderline intolerable. 🥵 Thankfully I was able to take fluid on at mile 10 and 14 (thanks Elle!) and jump in a pool (thanks Matt!) at mile 12 and 15 to keep the body temp in check. 

This was a week to absorb the increase loading and ensure the body stays healthy ✅ 

## **The Work**
The 800 workout this week felt light relative to last week. Most likley due to the temperature being down that morning and the total volume being a bit shorter. The long run described above was interesting and I was simply glad I didn't end up crying in a ditch. 

#### **Distance:** 58 miles (-5 miles)  

#### **Time:** 7 hours 5 minutes (-27 minutes)

#### **Elevation Gain:** 791 feet

## **Health**
My poor knees 😂 Did 4 hours of flooring work in my house so I was on my knees allot and then you know the running thing. So yea. Pray for my knees. As of Monday evening I am healthy with just very tired legs.
