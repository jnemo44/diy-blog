It's cool to see how the simple act of registering for a marathon translates into an ability to withstand a bit more pain. *Having a goal with a deadline is in itself a superpower.*

Last week I signed up for **California International Marathon** which was recently dubbed the **2022 USATF Marathon Road Championship** and so I'm off to train!

## The Numbers

It's been a gradual increase to the maintanance fitness I have been doing for the last two months. In total around 5-10 minutes of time added per day with two focus days that included some short mildly fast reps and a progression run that turned into a just survive and finish run due to the 95 degree heat.

### Stats
#### **Distance:** 52.12 miles  

#### **Time:** 6 hours  

#### **Elevation Gain:** 666 feet

## Health

Even with a slight increase in overall volume I can feel the loading on my legs and my overall evergy level. This could also be due to the fact I started nightime potty training child #3 AND some busier work days.
