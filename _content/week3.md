With a workout that felt hard on Wednesday and an actual long run on Sunday, this week was the first to feel like real marathon training. I also had the added bonus of trying to get my Friday-Sunday runs while managing 4 kids with my wife out of town! Here's how that went...

**Friday** - Nanny allowed me to do a normal 9 miles

**Saturday** - 22.5 laps around my neighborhood during nap time for 9 miles 

**Sunday** - 42.5 laps around my neighborhood during nap time for 17 miles

Both Saturday and Sunday were days I'd have rather just curled up on the couch and watched üèà. I was a solo dad and it was üåßÔ∏è and I just didn't have the energy. But that wouldn't have really translated into marathon success so I just nutted up and got outside.

## **The Work**
#### **Distance:** 63 miles (+16 miles)  

#### **Time:** 7 hours 32 minutes (+1 hour 46 minutes)

#### **Elevation Gain:** 1280 feet

## **Health**
This was a fairly large increase in both total volume and intensity which is genreraly not the ideal way to train, but **California International Marathon** is only 12 weeks away so it's time to start moving. Body is tired, but healthy and it will be interesting to see how I bounce back from this weeks training.
