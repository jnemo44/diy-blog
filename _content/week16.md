Wanted to share what I learned the first half of December. **THE DEW POINT MATTERS EVEN IF ITS NOT HOT OUTSIDE!!!** Shocking right? Not really I'm just a slow learner. Details below... 

Just over a week ago I did NOT love running. I was starting to have major resistance getting out the door each day. Usually I get excited for workout days and long runs, but even these runs were starting to feel daunting. My most recent two long runs had both been mental slug fests. In one I blew up with a mile and half to go, and the second it took me 5 miles to actually get into a rhythm where I wasn't wishing I could stop and go cry under a rock. Simple Plan's, "I just want to scream, how could this happen to me?" conjured from the bowels of my brain was all I could think about (so weird!). Some good old fashioned angst was apparently needed to help my brain cope with how 5:20 pace was feeling??? For reference a normal workout/long run day for me feels challenging, but in a really good way. It feels healthy and most of the time I really enjoy running fast and clicking through miles. It's hard to explain, but to have 5 miles of my brain screaming at me to stop is **NOT** normal.

**SO WHAT WAS GOING ON??!!**

Thankfully I have a coach who has a brain and over the past week we've discovered what's been causing this loathing to run. It's called Florida went from beautiful cool and clean days, back to a muggy fest and I did not adapt. The average dew point the first two weeks in December has been 62 degrees with an average temp of 66. So yea it's been moist, but not **HOT**. Like you go outside and you don't think twice about modifying pace like I'm used to doing in the summer heat. 

So I was holding normal paces despite high humidity which made my workouts **VERY** hard which led to pain and suffering which led to Simple Plan lyrics in my head.

This was verified last week as I rolled out for **3x3 mile repeats** planned to be at 5:05 (Threshold) pace. With a dew point of 66 my coach advised going for 5:20 instead. I did just that and although the run was not easy and doesn't seem that **"cool"** because it's repeats at marathon pace it was **the right workout for the day!** It also confirms that all this resistance was my subconscience brain trying to tell me to slow down cause it's hard to run fast while inhaling water. Thankfully the dew point has dropped again and last weeks long run at 5:30's was a positive experience. And so I will promptly forget the lesson I just learned which is why I'm writing this so I remember. After all...I've made my mistakes. Got nowhere to run. Life goes on as I'm....That song will never leave me.
