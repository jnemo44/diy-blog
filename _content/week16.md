Okay real talk. I don't love running right now. It's all feeling the same and my last two long runs have both been mental slug fests. In one I blew up with a mile and half to go, and the second it took me 5 miles to actually get into a rhythm where I wasn't wishing I could stop and go cry under a rock. Simple Plan's, "I just want to scream, how could this happen to me?" conjured from the bowels of my brain was all I could think about (so weird!). Some good old fashioned angst was apparently needed to help my brain cope with how 5:20 pace was feeling.

**WHAT WAS GOING ON??!!**

Thankfully I have a coach who has a real brain and over the past few days I think I've discovered what's been causing this loathing to run and incredibly painful workout days. It's called Florida went from beautiful cool and clean days, back to muggy fest and I did not adapt. The average dew point the last 14 days has been 62 degrees with an average temp of 66. So yea it's been moist, but not **HOT**. Like you go outside and you don't think twice about modifying pace like I'm used to doing in the summer heat. 

So I was holding normal paces despite high humidity which made my workouts **VERY** hard which led to pain and suffering which led to Simple Plan lyrics in my head.

This was verified today as I rolled out for **3x3 mile repeats** planned to be at 5:05 (Threshold) pace. With a dew point of 66 my coach advised going for 5:20 instead. I did just that and although the run was not easy and doesn't seem that **"cool"** because it's repeats at marathon pace it was **the right workout for the day!** It also confirms that my issue above was simply caused by trying to run fast while inhaling water. Thankfully the dew point is headed back to the 40's in the next few days so I will promptly forget the lesson I just learned. I've made my mistakes. Got nowhere to run. That song will never leave me.
