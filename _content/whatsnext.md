Ok so I missed the OTQ standard by 186 seconds or roughly 7 seconds per mile so I guess it's time to hang up the shoes and call it a season...said no one ever...like my father used to tell me when I failed at something growing up. Joe you gotta get back on the horse. Well that's what I'm doing. I'm racing March 4th in Elizabeth City, NC at the inaugural Coast Guard Marathon!

Here was my thought process...

1. I'm upset at myself for poor race execution. I've got a chip on my shoulder.
2. I'm pretty sure I have the fitness to run the OTQ.
3. I do NOT want to wait another 2 months+ to race again.
4. I need to race again before the summer gates of hot lava open in the south.

But can I get healthy and ready to race in just over a month and a half?

I have done two marathons within a month of each other before and it didn't go well. Historically I'd say I'm a generally slow recoverer, but the thought of trying to keep this level of fitness till the end of April when there are some other Marathons did not sound appealing. So with guidance from my coach we began the quick turn to get ready for another marathon. Here is how it's gone...

1. Houston Marathon
2. Off
3. Off
4. Off
5. First attempt at running...45 minutes on a treadmill @ 10 min/mile and it felt not good at all.
6. Ran 400 meters but had to stop because my left hip hurt so bad. Limping the rest of the day.
7. Day off
8. Ran 1 mile with limited hip pain
9. 45 easy
10. 45 easy
11. 45 easy
12. 45 easy
13. 45 easy
14. 60 easy
15. Off
16. 60 easy left foot hurts
17. First Workout back. Left foot hurts less.
18. 40 easy. No left foot pain.
19. 60 easy
20. Second Workout
21. 65 easy
22. Long Run 103 minutes

I am honestly so pumped at how quickly my body has gotten back to form. Letting me get my first workout in only 16 days and back to a "normal" volume within 21 days after racing a marathon! My lesson learned is probably waiting at least 6 days before first run. I was fortunate my hip didn't turn into something major.

At this point I have bought tickets and am confident that I will be able to get to the line healthy!
