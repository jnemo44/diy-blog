For this race I represented Operation Underground Railroad, which is an organization working to end modern day slavery. If my running has ever inspired you would you consider joining the fight?

## The Good
- Fueling went well. Consumed 5 gels during the race plus on course fluid (50C). One at the start (600C). Breakfast of two oatmeals (400C), banana (100C), Maurten Fluid (160C) and coffee. So 1310 Calories consumed before the end of the race. I don't think fuel was an issue for this race.
- Mentally strong. Was able to push through several rough patches before I bonked.
- Confident despite some fast early miles.

## The Bad
- Didn't run my race the first 8 miles. Got carried away and lost track of splits. 
- Was way to far back at the start for a top 20 finish. Need to make sure I get in the elite field or be more aggressive moving up before the start.

## The Start
The Houston start is chaos. They have both the men's and woman's marathon and half-marathon start at the same time. To try to ensure proper placement of athletes they have the following waves in order of speed...Elite, American Development Program(ADP), A, B, C, D. Each group has it's own staging area, but Elites and ADP groups have separate space to warmup and separate portable toilets. Both times at Houston I've been in the ADP group.

At 6:45 the ADP gate is closed and at 6:50 the gate blocking the hoards in Group A is released and they surge forward to fill the space behind ADP and then the ADP group collapses onto the elite filed that's already on the start line. Once this happens you are where you are it's packed so tight. I had just come out of the bathroom when the A group was released and was essentially crunched into the back of the ADP group. I moved up a few rows and even though in a field of elite male and female runner I am on the taller and heavier side I'm not a guy who's going to physically move people out of my way. So there I was about 100 people in front of me. When the gun went off it took about 20 seconds for me to actually cross the mat. I should have been further up, but I shouldn't have been so hardcore about getting my first mile split.


## Mile 1-8
I am 30 year's old with lots of racing experience, but sometimes hard lessons are relearned. **THE FIRST 10 MILES OF A MARATHON SHOULD BE BORING!!!!!** It's a warmup and it is a really good idea to take manual splits to ensure what you **FEEL** matches reality. With coffee and just the hype of being in a major marathon my normal ability to feel pace within a second or two per mile is distorted. I had planned to do this, but I **failed** to execute. Here's what happened... 

I missed the 1 mile marker and split 10:29 at mile 2. Probably a bit fast based on how slow I had to run the first 400 meters, but not a big deal. Then I proceeded to miss mile 3 and split 10:14 at mile 4. This should have been a red flag, but I saw this and did not slow down. I don't know why. That's a 5:07 average but my brain did not compute that when I saw it and I failed to respond. Had I split every mile and seen a 5:07 on my watch I know I would have slowed down. My best guess is that I saw the 14 and thought 5:14? Either way it's shocking to me that even with the correct data poor decisions are made when under stress.

Then came the nail in the coffin. I didn't manual split again for the next **4 MILES!!!** Even writing this I'm like **JOE WTF!!!** How? Why? When I did split at mile 8 it was a 20:43 and if I wasn't able to divide by 2 earlier, dividing by 4 was certainly not happening. That's a 5:11 avg. Just too fast for my fitness level on a 57 degree day. I believe this 8 mile stretch defined my race and prevented me from reaching either of my race goals. I had the plan. New the splits. But failed to respond.

## Mile 9-15
Despite the damage being done I finally had a group of 4 to run with and I was now taking mile splits. Holding 5:15 pace and feeling great doing it. This part of the course is quiet and it really is a cool experience to be ripping 5:15's with 4 other dudes on some road in Texas. There were hard minutes very similar to a cloudy day where direct sunlight gets masked only to be unleashed again after a few minutes. I was in a flow state and I could tell when a hard spot was coming and just worked through it. I new I was far ahead of pace and was just rolling.

## Mile 16-Finish
I let the group of 4 go around this time because they were notching up the pace and I was starting to feel the effects of the first 10k. I knew I was still well ahead of pace and thought my best chance was to just hold onto 5:15. But it got lonely! Miles started to slow. From 19-24 I dropped to 5:20-5:30 pace and finally was passed by the lead woman marathoner and her lead car that said the estimated finish time was 2:19. The game was over. I walked for 10 seconds. Had about a minute of tears as I started jogging again. Finished at 6:50 pace in a total time of 2:21:06.

## Summary
As I reflect on the poor execution in the first 10 miles it seems to have come down to two things. Tunnel vision and improperly applied belief. 
    1. I was fixated on finding "the" OTQ pack. I was expecting a large OTQ group to form as it had in 2020, but unlike 2020 I didn't want to wait till mile 10 to be a part of the group. With wind on the course possible I wanted to find the group and tuck in. So I ignored splits because my focus was looking for a group that didn't form until.....mile 10 and they came from behind till we had a group of 5 with two going on to OTQ. I didn't need a group from 1-10. I needed to run my race.
    2. You can have all the belief in the world, but if your plane doesn't have wings it won't fly. I wanted the OTQ, but I also wanted a PR (sub 2:17:18) and dreamed I could have a repeat of Houston 2020 just faster. I saw a pace car at mile 5 or 6 that said the estimated finish time was 2:16:40 and I felt good so I ignored the watch/splits and just ran on feel. But this isn't entirely negative and I actually view this as growth. Dreamer is a label that fits my wife a whole lot better then me. Historically I've been a fairly conservative racer and often undersell my ability in races, but I'm becoming a much more confident runner as I age. I was never scared or timid during this race. I got out aggressive. Saw an aggressive time and kept going. This will come in handy when I get to mile 20 on a day I've paced well.

## Splits
**Manual Split** - This is what I saw during the race. None means I forgot/missed a split.<br />
**GPS Split** - This is what Strava says mile paces were post race.
