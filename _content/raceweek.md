Wanted to capture a marathon race week one day at a time. No filter. Probably super boring, but always enjoy the emotion and mental aspect of race prep and I wanted to share what I'm thinking. Oh and if you want to track me on Sunday checkout the link below!

## Monday
A normal day. So normal in fact that as I write this I have a hard time believing I'm supposed to run a marathon this weekend! Did an easy 55 minute run today and my legs actually felt like they wanted to run for the first time in probably a week and a half. My focus for this week is just stretching, rest, and carbs. As of last week I'm also caffeine free till race day just to help keep from getting excited for no reason. The only time I did feel some excitement today was after getting a text from my coach with a weather update and some race week reminders. It's getting real and his excitement got me excited. Other then that I prefer to keep my excitement and emotion in a bottle on race week. Just keep storing it up. No **ADRENALINE** allowed!! Until race day. Wrapping up the day with stretching and 20 minutes in compression boots. 

## Tuesday
Legs are starting to tell me hey dude when are we doing our next workout? The feel unloaded which is a feeling I haven't had in months. 55 minutes again today while pushing Harper in the double stroller. Looked up splits today from Houston 2020 and started visualizing my strategy. Nothing in stone yet but coming up with some general ideas. Starting @ ~5:20's before moving towards 5:15ish goal pace. Seeing low 1:09 at the half. Negative split. Nutrition game plan. Basically trying to replicate Houston 2020, but a little faster. That said I'm also not trying to put pressure on the performance. 2020 Houston was a special race and it was dam near perfect from a splits perspective. However, I've done enough marathoning to know **EVERY MARATHON IS DIFFERENT** and you have to go with what you get on the day. For Sunday the main objective is **2:17:59** or faster. Bonus goal is to PR and go sub **2:17**. That said I want to leave room for the objectives to evolve based on how things feel when I get there and again when I'm at mile 20. Anything is possible.
