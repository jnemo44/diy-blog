For this race I will again be representing Operation Underground Railroad, which is an organization working to end modern day slavery. If my running has ever inspired you would you consider joining the fight?

## Training Summary

I honestly still can't believe I will be running a third marathon this year. Looking at my last blog entry I realized I never even debriefed my bouncback race attempt in Napa after falling short at Houston. I'll do that now.

## Napa Marathon March 2023

It was traumatic. The end.

## Training Summary Continued...

### Backdrop
Okay now that's updated I'm moving on. After Napa I spent about 6 months NOT training. I still ran most days but never more then 5 miles. Sometimes I would bike. Sometimes I'd just pull weeds in my front yard. I needed space and time away from the sport to learn to love it again. **Breaks are healthy** if you want to go long time in this sport.

However, after waiting all summer for some new spurt of motiviation to appear I still wasn't "feeling" like it. But time was ticking and by late August I was at the now or never point for having enough time to buildup for CIM. CIM is the LAST possible chance to snag an OTQ (sub 2:18) for the 2024 Olympic Cycle. At this point I wish I could say one day I woke up and was like LETS GO, but I will credit my beautfiul wife for giving me the friendly nudge out the door. 

I'm pretty sure I was like babe I have a new job, I got 4 kids, and like the weight of the world is on my shoulders (I'm dramatic sometimes) and she's like Joe you have a gift and I will support you continuing to use it and you can probably figure it out.Next morning I did my first 10 mile run in 6 months. 

### Buildup
It's been short. 15 weeks. Probably the thing I'm the most "worried" about heading into tommorrow, but I have had some quality work and I am healthy. **When your healthy you wonder if you could have done more, when your injured you wish you would have done less**. It's the nature of the sport and I'll find out tommorrow what is actually inside.

### CIM
I am **VERY** excited to race CIM. It's one of those races everyone talks about and I've almost done it several times over the past few years but the stars never aligned. CIM has a well run elite program that provides bottle support (7 bottles total) and some other race day perks that make it a great option for OTQ hopefuls. That combined with the fact this is a last chance opportunity means that there should be a solid pack of 2:18 level guys.

### My Plan
I am **NOT** going out faster then 5:20 for the first 5k. The lessons learned in [Houston](./postrace.md) are still very fresh in my mind. Since there will be an OTQ pacer and large pack though I'll just have to balance doing my own thing after 5k or 10k or getting the beneifts of running in a group. But **I WILL NOT GO FASTER THEN 5:15 IN THE FIRST 10miles!**. To aid in pacing this will be my first race using the PacPro feature on Garmin which should help guide my decision making when my brain turns to mush. Other then that it's fuel every 4 miles and just run smart.
