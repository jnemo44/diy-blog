This week featured two workouts that were just really **FUN!** It's probably weird, but fun for me is pushing the boundaries of my physical limits in a healthy and sustainable way.

On Wednesday it was **20 x 400's**. A classic that I don't think I've done since the college days? After 5 reps we were smiling and I can clearly remember my college coach proclaiming with a smile, ***"It's all fun and games for the first 10"***. That was almost true on Wednesday, however I'd say it didn't really feel hard till the 13th rep. My quads and hip flexors were the lim fac towards the end of this workout. I was running faster then planned at **67-69's** each lap and wasn't having much trouble, but those last 5-7 reps felt like a workout as my legs started to age. But I finished strong and made the last 3 reps my fastest to snag a mental win in addition to any physical gains.

I was sore the next day. And the next. And even by Saturday I would say I still had some lingering fatigue from those 400's. Just in time for a Saturday **whopper!** (just the sandwich please) After a 3 mile warmup I was to modulate pace between **low 5's/mile** for 400m to **high 5's/mile** for 800m and do that 15 times. Nothing crazy, but on tired quads this felt kinda like the 16-18 mile part of a marathon. Your spring chicken legs are dead and gone and you now have barrels of whiskey strapped to your legs while you try to get away from the **prohibition police**. It took forever, but I was proud of this workout and I'm excited to see what comes next!

## **Health**
Overall volume was down this week, but I had a few late nights this week so my body feels like it's done 80+ miles. Plan to catch up on some sleep this week in the **BAHAMAS!!!**
