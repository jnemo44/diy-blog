A smooth sailing Wednesday workout resulted in a promotion to my VDOT number which led to an awesomely productive long run. I ❤️ running because of how quickly consistency can translate into tangible fitness. 

I also ❤️❤️ progressive long runs. During the warmup miles my legs felt flat and sluggish (it was 6am on a Sunday). My watch dinged and I dropped pace to 5:40 and I was like no way is this happening today. It's to silly for this to be happening right now...

**But** after about 5 minutes of feeling like an old clunky car there was a gear switch and I got into my flow state (yes flow is real). **13 miles** later I had sustained sub 5:30ish pace for most of the run. 

**Bottom Line:** Don't judge a run by the first 10-20 minutes. Some days it just takes a while to figure out where your body is at!

## **The Work**

## **Health**
Left knee bounced back by the Wednesday workout and havn't felt it the rest of the week. Trying to manage general fatigue and what I like to call my long run hangover. No headache or vommiting I just feel kinda like a low energy zombie 30 hours after a long run.
