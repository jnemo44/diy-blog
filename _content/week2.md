Stress is stress is stress. 
    
    Running stress + Work stress + Life stress = Total stress 

It's a phrase I was introduced to in college and it's something that I have to be cognizant of when activley training. It's not simply the stress of running that you have to deal with and recover from. Running involves a large mental component so your total stress amount will impact how much running stress you can take. Total stress is a finite number so if work stress and life stress are high then running stress has to be reduced to ensure total stress doesn't exceed your limits.

**Week 2** was one of those weeks. Work stress was up (not bad just a fact) and I continue to wake up every night as I nightime potty train child number 3. I also acquired a minor stomach bug that forced me to finish Tuesday with a paltry 20 minute run due to excessive ðŸ’©. Despite a lower mileage week I was still able get in both quality sessions and finish the week **strong**!

## The Numbers


### Stats
#### **Distance:** 47.78 miles  

#### **Time:** 5 hours 46 minutes  

#### **Elevation Gain:** 600 feet  

---------------------------
The first quality session was done on a treadmill and felt fairly easy albiet fast. The Sunday threshold work was done at noon in the heat and although I stayed strong through the 5x1 mile reps I was not mentally prepared for the 200's and broke. It was a reminder I need to study my workout before I run it to ensure I properly segment the workout in my mind!

## Health
Legs feel healthy, but I did essentially miss Tuesday due to a mild stomach bug. Or maybe I was just nervous for a work presentation I had the following day. No other issues this week!
