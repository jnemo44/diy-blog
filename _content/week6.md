**Story time.** Once upon a Sunday I was cranking through a 19 mile long run of loops around my neighborhood. It featured four reps of 2 miles at marathon pace followed by a half mile at half marathon pace. It was hot (85F), but the sun was going down and the dewpoint was somwhere in the 50's so the air was clean and I was feeling pretty good. That was until the start of the 4th set. I was pretty toasty and fatigued at this point and with a mile to go in my final two mile rep I was ready to call it quits. I had **pumped** all the **pump** out of my **pump** up music and figured I had done enough to call it quits. 

**But** then I heard a squeaky chain coming up behind me üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I was shocked to find my seven year old daughter had chased me down on her bike! These reps were run at 5:40 pace so to see her bike me down was all the motivation I needed to finish strong. She even gave me a drink of her water! It was a proud Dad moment and I'm so thankful I got to share a piece of my workout with her.‚ù§Ô∏è 

**This run** was a sweet reminder of one of my **WHY's** which is being able to **show** and experience the joy of fitness with my family.
