My legs have felt like trash nuggets for a solid week and a half. Running has not been super exciting recently. The week before race week intensity and volume start to come down a smudge so I expect to feel fresh and lite. But instead...trash nuggets. 

It's amazing how even one or two bad workouts can make you question all 18 weeks of training. Did I peak already? Am I still fit enough to race a marathon? Why do I feel so crappy? **WHY AM I DOING THIS SPORT!!??**
