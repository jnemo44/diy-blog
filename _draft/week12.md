Okay so it's week 12 and I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel for content. And what I have found at the bottom of the barrel is a truly awesome discovery. I really think I'm onto something! 

**Next intense workout try listening to piano music!** No words. No covers. Just a tickling of the ivory.

Ok so typically I would default to some hard rock or EDM when working out, but during some recent workouts I've had piano songs come on and it's wierd how the calm tone of the music actually helps me stay relaxed despite the phyiscal pain of the workout. Running (any hard work really) is **SO** mental and staying calm and relaxed despite pain is at the crux of racing. During a race you have to find ways to disconect from what your body is **feeling**. The feeling of pain is your bodies way of communicating **STOP!!** And only during a race are you allowed to ignore this primal feedback loop. But how do I get better at ignoring pain? Enter piano music. It's essentially like a wet blanket on the fire of pain I start to feel during workouts.   

While normally reserved for hotel lobbies, elevators, and my living room during nap time piano music has found it's way onto my workout playlist and it's there to stay!

## **Health**
Highest mileage week in a long time. Still a light twinge in the left achillis. Keeping an eye on it, but not much else.
